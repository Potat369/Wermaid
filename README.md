This is a school project, made in 3 months. Of course it could've been much and much shorter, but it's our first _serious_ project so we've spent a lot of time of unsiginificant things. But overally i satisfied with the garbage code we wrote.

Things i learned:
- React
- Vite
- React Router
- TailwindCSS
- Using and creating own API
- A bit of auth

And much much more!
